    "# Search for datasets coincident with a list of points\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical oceanographer is interested in obtaining ICESat-2 sea ice height in Baffin Bay close to ARGO floats.  This kind of search could be done using EarthData search.  First by getting the coordinates of the ARGO floats and then typing the coordinates into the search box.  However, this workflow could get tedious, especially if the search needs to be repeated.  Furthermore, the search is not easily made reproduceable.  Reproduceability is critical if you need to completely redo your analysis yourself, or if others want to recreate your reanalysis.  By capturing the search in code, either in a notebook such as this one or in a script, you or anyone else can reproduce the search and any subsequent analysis.\n",

    "Similar use cases would be to select data coincident with a cruise, with ice mass balance buoys in Arctic and Antarctic, or the MOSAIC experiment.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will use python but a similar approach could be taken using R, Matlab or IDL.  You will convert a list of coordinates for ARGO floats into a GeoJSON file; use this file to write a query to the CMR API and order data.  Finally we will visualize the data to produce a plot siilar to the one below.\n",

    "The Python ecosystem is organized into modules.  A module must be imported before the contents of that modules can be used.  It is good practice to import modules in the first code cell of a notebook or at the top of your script.  Not only does this make it clear which modules are being used, but it also ensures that the code fails at the beginning because one of the modules is not installed rather half way through after crunching a load of data.\n",

    "For some modules, it is common practice to shorten the module names according to accepted conventions.  For example, the plotting module `matplotlib.pyplot` is shortened to `plt`.  It is best to stick to these conventions rather than making up your own short names so that people reading your code see immediately what you are doing. "
